              I'm a full-stack software engineer with over seven years of
              experience crafting scalable applications that solve real-world
              problems. My journey into tech began unconventionally, as I spent
              nearly a decade as an entrepreneur, building and scaling a cooking
              education business from nothing to over $600k in annual revenue
              before its acquisition.

              This entrepreneurial background gives me a unique perspective in
              software development. I understand how technology decisions impact
              business outcomes, user experience, and long-term growth. Whether
              developing backend services in C# and ASP.NET or building
              responsive frontend applications with React and Angular, I always
              try to keep the end user in mind.

              What really motivates me is building technology that makes a
              difference in people's lives. While I love solving complex
              technical problems, what I really enjoy is knowing that my work
              helps make someone else's day easier.

              When I'm not at the computer, I'm busy being a mom to my son and
              wrangling my two German Shepherd rescues. I also love woodworking!
              Right now it's building furniture and doing trim carpentry around
              the house. I still enjoy my pastry chef roots by baking fresh
              bread for my family every week. There's something deeply
              satisfying about creating something tangible with your hands,
              whether it's a piece of custom furniture, a perfect loaf of bread,
              or clean, efficient code.
