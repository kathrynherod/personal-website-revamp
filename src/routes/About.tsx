                I'm a full-stack software engineer with over seven years of
                experience crafting scalable applications that solve real-world
                problems. My journey into tech began unconventionally, as I
                spent nearly a decade as an entrepreneur, building and scaling a
                cooking education business from nothing to over $600k in annual
                revenue before its acquisition.

                This entrepreneurial background gives me a unique perspective in
                software development. I understand how technology decisions
                impact business outcomes, user experience, and long-term growth.
                Whether architecting backend services in C# and ASP.NET or
                building responsive frontend applications with React and
                Angular, I always keep the bigger picture ADN the end user in
                mind.
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                What really motivates me is building technology that makes a
                difference in people's lives. I love solving complex technical
                problems, but what I really enjoy is knowing that the
                application I'm building will help someone do their job better
                or make their day a little easier. Throughout my career, I've
                focused on mentoring other developers and keeping our users at
                the center of everything we build.
              </Typography>

                When I'm not at the computer, I'm busy being a mom to my son and
                wrangling my two German Shepherd rescues. I also love
                woodworking. Right now it's building furniture and doing trim
                carpentry around the house. I still enjoy my pastry chef roots
                by baking fresh bread for my family every week. There's
                something deeply satisfying about creating something tangible
                with your hands, whether it's a piece of custom furniture, a
                perfect loaf of bread, or clean, efficient code.
